# CMSSpreadOption
A constant maturity swap (CMS) spread option makes payments based on a bounded spread between two index rates (e.g., a GBP CMS rate and a EURO CMS rate).  The GBP CMS rate is calculated from a 15 year swap with semi-annual, upfront payments, while the EURO CMS rate is based on a 15 year swap with annual, upfront payments.
